# Telegram bot 

Telegram Book & VPN Bot
A Telegram bot that provides book recommendations using the Google Books API and distributes VPN codes upon subscribing to required Telegram channels. Admins can manage the list of required channels and set an active VPN code dynamically without editing configuration files. The bot includes anti-spam measures to prevent abuse. Built with Node.js and free, open-source dependencies for a cost-effective solution.

Features

Book Recommendations: Search for books using the public Google Books API with the /book <query> command (e.g., /book javascript).
VPN Code Distribution: Grants the active VPN code via the /vpn command, requiring non-admin users to subscribe to specified Telegram channels.
Dynamic Channel Management: Admins can update required channels using /admin <password> <channels> (e.g., /admin merdan1201 ["@channel1","@channel2"]), stored in channels.json for persistence.
VPN Code Management: Admins can set the active VPN code using /vpn <password> <code> (e.g., /vpn merdan1201 VPN-XYZ12345), stored in vpn_codes.json. The latest code is assigned to users, replacing their previous code.
Anti-Spam Protection:
Limits /vpn to 3 requests per 30 seconds and other commands (/book, /start, /help) to 10 requests per 60 seconds.
Temporarily blocks users for 5 minutes if limits are exceeded.
Warns users when nearing limits.
Admins bypass anti-spam restrictions.

Admin Bypass: Admins bypass channel subscription and anti-spam requirements for VPN codes.
Interactive Interface: /start command provides buttons for Books and VPN options.
Help Command: /help lists all commands.
Logging: Comprehensive logging with winston for debugging and monitoring.
Mobile-Friendly: Optimized responses for Telegram mobile clients (iOS/Android).
Free & Lightweight: Uses free dependencies and file-based persistence (channels.json, vpn_codes.json) to avoid paid databases.

Anti-Spam Behavior

Rate Limits:
/vpn: 3 requests per 30 seconds.
/book, /start, /help: 10 requests per 60 seconds.
Admin commands (/admin, /vpn <password> <code>) and admin users bypass limits.

Warnings:
At limit (e.g., 3rd /vpn in 30 seconds):‚ö†Ô∏è You‚Äôre sending /vpn too fast. Slow down to avoid a 5-minute block.

Blocking:
Exceed limit (e.g., 4th /vpn in 30 seconds):üö´ Slow down! You‚Äôve sent too many /vpn commands. You‚Äôre blocked for 5 minutes.

While blocked:üö´ You‚Äôre temporarily blocked for spamming. Try again in X minute(s).

Admin Workflow

Set channels:/admin merdan1201 ["@Turkmen_Shadowsocks","@ubuntu24lts"]

Set active VPN code:/vpn merdan1201 VPN-XYZ12345

Update VPN code:/vpn merdan1201 VPN-ABC67890

Non-admins must subscribe to all listed channels and respect anti-spam limits to use /vpn.

Troubleshooting

Anti-Spam Blocking Legitimate Users:

Symptom: Users blocked too quickly.
Fix:
Check logs for User ... exceeded vpn limit or general limit.
Adjust antiSpamConfig in index.js (e.g., increase vpn.limit to 5).
Share logs and user feedback.

Anti-Spam Not Triggering:

Symptom: Spammers not blocked.
Fix:
Confirm user is not in admins Set.
Check logs for nearing vpn limit or exceeded vpn limit.
Rapidly send /vpn 4 times in 30 seconds, verify block.
Share logs and userRequests state (add console.log(userRequests) in middleware).

Multiple Codes Returned (Looping):

Symptom: /vpn returns multiple codes in a loop.
Fix:
Check logs for repeated Assigned VPN code ... to user ....
Delete vpn_codes.json, run /vpn merdan1201 VPN-XYZ12345, then /vpn.
Ensure single /vpn command execution (no rapid repeats).
Share logs, vpn_codes.json, and screenshot of looping output.

Wrong VPN Code Assigned:

Symptom: /vpn doesn‚Äôt return the added code.
Fix:
Check vpn_codes.json for available_codes and active_code.
Verify logs for Assigned VPN code ... to user ....
Delete vpn_codes.json, retry /vpn merdan1201 VPN-XYZ12345, then /vpn.

Empty REQUIRED_CHANNELS or vpn_codes.json:

Symptom: /vpn grants codes without subscriptions or no codes available.
Fix:
Check logs for Invalid /admin input or Invalid /vpn add input.
Ensure bot is an admin in channels.
Verify channels.json and vpn_codes.json exist and update.
Check for Failed to save ... (move to writable directory).

Mobile Text Issues:

Symptom: /vpn channel list, code, or anti-spam messages don‚Äôt display on mobile.
Fix:
Uses Markdown for channel list and MarkdownV2 for others; test on iOS/Android.
Share mobile OS, Telegram version, and screenshot.
Try plain text response by removing parse_mode.

Bot Crashes:

Fix:
Check logs for errors (e.g., MarkdownV2 parsing).
Ensure escapeMarkdownV2 is applied.
Share full logs.

Subscription Check Fails:

Symptom: /vpn doesn‚Äôt recognize subscriptions.
Fix:
Ensure bot is an admin in all channels.
Confirm channels are public.
Check logs for Failed to check subscription for ....

Permission Issues:

Symptom: Failed to save channels to channels.json or vpn_codes.json.
Fix:
